# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
2. Return `k`.

## Approaches

### Approach 1: Two-Pointer Technique
This approach uses two pointers to keep track of the unique elements and overwrite the duplicates in the array.

- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
